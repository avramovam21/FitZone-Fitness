                    Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                    Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                    Lorem
                    Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
                    undoubtable
                    source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
                    Extremes
                    of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
                    popular
                    during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line

                    section 1.10.32.

                        When we meditate, we inject far-reaching and long-lasting benefits into our lives: We lower our
                        stress levels, we get to know our pain, we connect better, we improve our focus, and we're
                        kinder to ourselves. Let us walk you through the basics in our new mindful guide on how to
                        meditate.
